Everyone is welcome!

At the Woodbury Seventh-day Adventist church our emphasis is on serving the community.
We have many ministries to further this goal including: a bread ministry, a small church school,
and many other community outreach programs.

You may have wondered why we call ourselves "Seventh-day" Adventists. The reason is simple.
We believe in following the Bible exactly as it was written, and do not believe that man has
the right to alter it. Thus, we worship on Saturday, rather than Sunday. The simple reason
for this is the fact that this is the day on which God intended for people to worship him.
Just look at our brothers the Jews who still honor this day, just as we do. Both of us
call Saturday the Sabbath and hold services on this day.

If you are interested in receiving a blessing from participating in our outreach programs
and following Jesus in the way in which he intended then you are in the right place!
