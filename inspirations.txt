  * I like the static image rather than having a carousel
  * I don't like the Learn More button
    (it is an interesting idea, however all it does is scroll down and
    seems to be cluttering up the page and can potentially confuse users)
  * I like the parallax background image effects
    However, it seems to make me sick. So don't do it!
  * I like the warm inviting text
  * I like the address and click for directions button
  * I like the navbar hover menu
  * I like the fact that the email address is a clickable (mailto) link.
