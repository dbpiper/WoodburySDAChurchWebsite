The oldest browsers supported are the following:

  * Chrome 49 (last version of Chrome available for Windows XP, Vista, OS X:
      10.6, 10.7, 10.8)
    as a result it still has about 0.71% of global market share according to
      https://caniuse.com
  * Internet Explorer 11 (only version of IE still supported by Microsoft)
    see: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/end-of-ie-support
    as a result it has about 2.71% global market share according to
      https://caniuse.com
  * iOS Safari 5.1 (7534.48.3) see:
      http://www.somegeekintn.com/blog/stuff/iosvers/
      last version of Safari available for: the original iPad, and the iPod 3G.

      It only has 0.02% global market share and 0.06% US market share, but
      my mother has an original iPad, and since the site should work on all
      of her devices, this is a requirement.

    - According to this site: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkitjs/touchevent
       iOS Safari 5.1 supports the TouchEvent interface, so this should be used
       for this browser.
    - Chrome 49 supports the old MouseEvent interface, so this should be used
      for it.
    - IE 11 and newer browsers support the PointerEvent interface, so
      this should be used for those.
  * No Viewport unit support
  * No Drag and Drop
  * No PNG favicons (so must use .ico)
  * No WebGL 3D Canvas Graphics
